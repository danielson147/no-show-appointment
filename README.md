# no-show-appointments
The purpose of this investigation is to analyze the dataset and come up with factors that could be responsible for patients not showing up for their appointments. This will help the hospitals to manage their staff in case patients did not show up as predicted. 
This dataset has information for 110,527 medical appointments in Brazil. It has 14 columns.
The dependent variable in the dataset is the No-show column because it depends on other variables, while the independent variables are Age, Scholarship, Hypertension, Diabetes, Handicap, Alcoholism and SMS_received. These independent variables could be responsible for the outcome of the dependent variable. Therefore, a patient showing up or not could depend on their age, gender, enrollment in Brasilian Welfare Program (Bolsa Familia), their health status (hypertensive, diabetics or handicap), their level of alcohol intake and wether he or she received SMS message, as a reminder, or not.

In this investigation, the following variables will be analyzed to determine the factors we need to consider in order to know if a patient will show up for his or her appointment or not:

1. Dependent variable: No-show
2. Independent variables: Age, Scholarship and SMS_received.
